## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/bethropolis/myia.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


3. Setup project:
    ```sh
    python setup.py 
    ```

4. create a virtual environment (optional):
    ```sh
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
    > activate the virtual environment
    ```bash
    # windows
    myenv\Scripts\activate

    # linux / mac
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```
5. run the app:
    ```sh
     python app.py
    ```
    > open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000

## Usage 

1. Upload images to the app

    - upload images to the `training directory`
    - head to `http://localhost:5000/directory?path=training/train` and upload your images


2. label the images

    - Open the `train` page (`http://localhost:5000/train`)

    - label the images either as good or bad by clicking the `thumbs up` or `thumbs down` button.

    - the app can only generate binary classification models so you can only label the images as `good` or `bad`

        - `thumbs up` for `good` which could represent classification `A`
        - `thumbs down` for `bad` which could represent classification `B`


    > currently the app only supports two labels `good` and `bad` 

3. build the model

     - To build the model, head to the `home` page (`http://localhost:5000/`) and click the `build model` button
     
     - In the next page you will have to input:
        `No of epochs` - the number of times the model will be trained (default is 15) 
        `No of layers` - the number of layers the model will have (default is 3)
        `Model name` - the name of the model (default is `myia_image_classifier`)

    - click the `build model` button to start building the model

    The model will be saved in the `model/image_model` directory as a `keras` model

    > Note: The higher the number of epochs the longer it will take to build the model 
    


4. test the model
        - To test the model, open the `test` page (`http://localhost:5000/test`) and upload an image to test the model with
           or test with images in the `test` directory (`http://localhost:5000/directory?path=training/test`)


5. evaluate the model
    - To evaluate the model, open the `evaluate` page (`http://localhost:5000/evaluate`) and upload an image to evaluate the model with
        or evaluate with images in the `evaluate` directory (`http://localhost:5000/directory?path=model/evaluation`)

    - The evaluation results will be saved in the `model` directory as a `json` file and a graph will be generated and saved in the `static` directory as a `png` file
